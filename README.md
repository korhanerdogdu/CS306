# CS306 - Database Systems (2024-2025)

This repository contains the project phases I completed for **CS306 - Database Systems** at Sabancƒ± University.  
The project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a real-life database application, from conceptual design to querying and refinement.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Design and implement a database application.
- Develop conceptual designs (e.g., Entity-Relationship models).
- Translate ER models into relational schemas.
- Apply normalization and schema refinement (normal forms, decomposition).
- Write and optimize queries using SQL.
- Understand database system concepts, including:
  - Concurrency control
  - Transaction management
  - Recovery
  - Data storage and indexing
  - NoSQL and graph database models

## üìù Project Submissions

This repository includes:
- All phases of the database application project (e.g., project proposal, ER diagram, relational model, normalization, SQL queries, reports).
- The project was implemented using **MySQL**.

Each phase demonstrates different aspects of database design and implementation:
- **Conceptual design (ER diagrams)**  
- **Relational schema mapping**  
- **Schema refinement to achieve normal forms**  
- **SQL query development and testing**
